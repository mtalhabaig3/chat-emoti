# chat-emoti
ChatEmoti is a 1 to 1 chat application which tells you how you are feeling after semantically analyzing your chat. I built this app in React Native and for the backend I used Firebase and Python. Two people chat for an hour on average, the app takes the chat and processes it at the backend in Python's AI trained model and returns 1 of the 27 emotions a person can feel. Each user gets their respective emotion based on his or her conversation. I am currently working on resolving the returned emotion by showing relevant content.
